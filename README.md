This repository contains Python solutions for the Week 1 Code Challenge. The challenges include:

1. Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
2. Checking if exactly two numbers are positive
3. Finding the highest value of consonant substrings

Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

This challenge focuses on converting a time from the 12-hour format (with "am" or "pm") to the 24-hour format.

    Function: convert_to_24_hour(hour, minute, period)

- Converts a given time from the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format.
- Arguments:
  - hour: Hour in the range of 1 to 12.
  - minute: Minute in the range of 0 to 59.
  - period: Either "am" or "pm".
- Returns:
  - A four-digit string representing the time in the 24-hour format.

Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

In this challenge, you need to determine if exactly two out of three given integers are positive.

    Function: positive_count(a, b, c)

- Checks if exactly two out of three integers are positive.
- Arguments:
  - a, b, c: Three integers.
- Returns:
  - True if exactly two of the integers are positive, otherwise False.

Challenge 3: Consonant value

This challenge involves finding the highest value of consonant substrings in a given string.

     Functions:
- is_consonant(char): Checks if a character is a consonant.
- get_consonant_value(char): Calculates the value of a consonant.
- highest_consonant_value(s): Finds the highest value of consonant substrings in a string.
